DESCRIPTION:
  Our game "Stack It" is a copy of the arcade game called Stacker. The objective
of the game is the stack the blocks to reach to finish line. Each time "Z" is
pressed on the nunchuk it will stop the current block and render a new block
above the previous one. After the player is done with the game, he or she may
press "C" to restart the game.

A few modification were made from the original Stacker game. For instance, in
our game, the x-axis position of the new block is generated at random. Also, to
make the game more challenging, each time new block is smaller than the one
before it.

For creativity, we created TWO 3D FLAGS to cheer the player during the game!

TASKS:
  Both Simon and I worked on the whole project together in Lab.
Here are the following tasks we completed while creating the game:

  1.) Created square on the screen
  2.) Add color to the square
  3.) Figure out how to move the block
  4.) Add collision detection whe the block hit a wall
  5.) Added nunchuk logic to the game
  6.) Figure out a good way to generate a new block on top of the old one
  7.) Decided and added background color
  8.) Added title banner
  9.) Accidentally discovered how to add the moving flags
  10.) Created a finish line detection
  11.) Created the algorithm for generating blocks from random x position
  12.) Decided the right speed that is not too easy nor too hard
  13.) Decided the right block size
  14.) Added flash screen when the player lost or won
  15.) Added winning and losing sounds 
  16.) Let the user play again
