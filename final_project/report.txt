Final Project Lab Report
report.txt

1)
We pair programmed every time we were working. 
So we did all the tasks listed on final_project.txt together. 
Our contribution allowed us to actually finish the project.

2)
It was quite challenging figuring out how to generate 
new stack blocks while keeping the old block and its position information. 
We had to play around with screen sizes and overall game speed 
to find out perfect block size and game speed to make game smoother 
without user noticing about stack block being generated part to part.

3)
I would add more visual effects such as making each elements of 
game using images to make the game look cooler. 
But right now, I am very satisfied with our current simple & basic look with cool 3D flag effect on the top of screen.
