How many connections are required to communicate over UART?
- 2 (RX and TX)

What is the purpose of "alternate functions" for GPIO pins?
-  a GPIO pin can be used for many peripheral we use "alternate functions" to specify 
   GPIO pin to be not used as IN, Out or analog so that it can be used for debugging in our case.

Define "baud rate" in your own words.
- baud rate is pulse per second. Altough not exactly the same concept, we can see baud rate in systems programming 
  as bit/s that it represents data rate for serial data transmission. We set proper baud rate for each 
  different peripherals that they support for serial communications.

Why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason that printf won't work on the board without it?
- We need newlib_stubs to prevent the library from buffing I/O. The board won't work with printf without it
  since data transmission to the board will be buffered and IO won't be occured immediately.

Give an example of a situation in which the Salae Logic Analyzer is the best debugging method and include a screen shot of the Logic application.
- Salae Logic Analyzer is the best debugging method when we are testing peripherals connected via serial.
  It gives us exact information when the peripheral is actually communicating or not.

What did you learn, any difficulties you had
- I learned how a system is communicating with peripherals through serial, basic concepts of RX/TX 
  and how to debug serial connected peripherals.
  It was really difficult to figure out how to attach Salae Logic Analyzer since the new one we were given in the lab
  did not work.
