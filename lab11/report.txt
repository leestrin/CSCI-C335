Difficulties:

It was difficult to understand concept of interrupt with queue.
We had no idea where to put flush_uart(), so it was trial and error procedure.

What I learned:

I really struggled during setting up branch in git. I finally learned that I have to "checkout" the branch before starting to work on branch itself.
