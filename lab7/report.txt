Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of printf debugging? Note: there is no right answer to this, we are just looking for your thoughts on the issue

- Advatages: It was a good way to test STM32's performance.
  Disadvantages: Just by debugging, we were not able to see what part of printf is causing system to slow down.

Explain why the spiReadWrite function is called inside a higher level peripheral function (the lcdWrite function).

- Each information is sent using  spiReadWrite to determine what to output in each pixels of LCD.

Why does LCD_CS_DEASSERT() do? Why is it important?

- LCD_CS_DEASSERT() is a macro that sets CS pin to high so that the peripheral is not communicating while initialization.

Explain how the character data from the ASCII array in glcdfont.c gets converted to pixels.

- Since a character in glcdfont.c can have up to five bytes with eight bits in each byte according to the lab manual, each byte represenets each columns of pixel. 
  Bits inside each byte determines pixel of the row to be on and off.

Give the exact timing difference between the two versions of f3d_lcd_fillScreen, from the Salae analyzer, and explain why the new function is faster.

  The new function is faster because it fills the screen by block of pixels at a time.

Difficulties 

- It was difficult to cast gyro sensor values to array of characters. We found a function sprintf online to solve this problem.
