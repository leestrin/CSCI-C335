Q1)
SD_CS_HIGH() allows data to port bits and executes the code,
SD_CS_LOW() clear data port bit and resets the data.

Q2)
We can use this function by putting it in while loop replacing delay.
timer is much more accurate since actual delay from delay loop can vary in different situations.

Q3)
Since processor can execute one thing at a time, DMA helps processor to efficiently order tasks to do.
As a result, it improves performance.

Q4)
File Allocation Table locates file in a space of memory disk. 
Corruption of an entry in the table such as two different files in a same location can cause
part of a file to be lost.

Q5)
FAT16 limits entries of 512, but FAT32 does not restrict the number of entries in the root folder.

Difficulties:
Hardware issue; even if we had right code, we could not test if the code was right because most of STM32 boards or
SD card had problems. I had to bring my own SD card and it worked fine without RC=3 error.

What I learn:
I learned that the file system we used had number of character restriction for bitmap file we tried to load.
I just made file name short and it worked.
