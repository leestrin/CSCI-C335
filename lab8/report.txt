min 2.16 - max 2.6v is required to power the accelerometer/magnetomete.
accelerometer/magnetometer, or LSM303DLHC is located above right side of the f3 discovery board.

Q2.

Since accelerometer/magnetomete data should be updated continuously, we write to the accelerometer/magnetometer before we can read from them.

Q3.

It converts 3 axis of accelerometer data to float.

Q4.

To calibrate compass data when the sensor is moving and data is changing by small number constantly.

Difficulties.
When we first initialized magnetomete, we were getting a radian number and couldn't figure out what this number meant.
We didn't convert it to degrees but we were able to use raw radian number for our compass application by comparing number to where the hardware actually points to.
