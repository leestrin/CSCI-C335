Q)
To make sure the communication is complete.

Q4)
Because it's not efficientto use xchng_datablock for transfer of less than 4 bytes

Q5)
Because the play speed could be affected by processing speed.

Difficulties:
It was hard to tell if my code was right or wrong because the board sometimes was not functioning at all.

What I learned:
I learned that we have to try every hardware we could to successfully test this lab.
I also learned that loading with low level DMA is much faster.
