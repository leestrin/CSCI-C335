Q1)
nunchuk is controlled via I2C. So we do not have to initialize pins in nunchuk.c

Q2)
f3d_i2c1_read_nunchuk does not take reg as parameter. This means that nunchuk is only using pre-set register that the function only will work for nunchuk.

Q3)
jx - joystick x axis
jy - joystick y axis
ax - accelerometer x axis
ay - accelerometer y axis
az - accelerometer z axis
c - c button
z - z button

Q4)
Each cases represent each possible combinations of button pressed.

case 0 - both z and c button pressed
case 1 - only c button pressed
case 2 - only z button pressed
case 3 - no button is pressed

Difficulties & What I learned)
At first, I did not know that I have to reset the LCD screen by fillScreen everytime I switch to other screen mode. I figured that the LCD does not print out properly without filling it with background, I applied fillScreen when ever I need major screen mode change.
