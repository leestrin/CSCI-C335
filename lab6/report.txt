What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?
- CS pin means Chip Select pin. It allows a device to communicate with peripherals.

Why do you set the CS high at the end of the pin initializations? What other functions in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high or high to low?
- We set CS high at the end of the pin initialization to stop the communication with peripherals with CS set low.
  f3d_gyro_write and f3d_gyro_read change change CS from high to low.

How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?
- We use 4 wire that are already connected to board for SPI communication.
  SPI communication is a master-slave network and it exchanges data by shifting data between an internal register in each device.

The STM has an Operating Frequency of 72 MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you set the baud rate prescaler to? What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?
- baud prescaler is set to 8.
  resulting SPI clock frequency: 10.5 MHz

Does a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler (master)? Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?
- Yes because we want to be able to communicate with peripherals that need certain transmission speed in order to communicate.

Describe what you learned and any difficulties you had
- We had difficulty figuring out how to allow user input to select axis. 
  We had to make a new version of getchar function from uart driver that does not stop the application and runs while reset button is not pressed.
  I learned how SPI bus communicates with peripherals.
