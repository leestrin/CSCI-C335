C335 HW1 report.txt

I used arm-none-eabi-nm --print-size HW1.elf to find out these information.

Address and size of global variable state. (10 pts)

- Address 00012fe8
- Size 4 bytes

Address and size of global variable state_counter. (10 pts)

- Address 00012fec
- Size 4 bytes

Starting address and size of function stop_light(). (10 pts)

- Starting address 00008afc
- Size 90bytes

Starting address and size of function inc(). (10 pts)

- Starting address 00008af8
- 0 bytes

Largest function in the executable HW1.elf. (10 pts)
- __malloc_av_ has the largest size of 408 bytes, but since malloc is just from C library,
  I assume that stop_light with size of 90 bytes is the largest function in HW1.elf.

Overall size of the executable HW1.elf in bytes. (10 pts)

- 59KB
