I was able to accomplish 
mywc.c that prints out numbers of line, word and characters
myprintf that is printf for printing int, string and hex by implementing
printint, printstring and printhex functions.
I also made test.c that tests myprintf.c

I was not familiar with C's representation of int, hex, and other variables for printf
and new line, tab etc that is representation for white spaces.
So I studied those through Lab 2 guide to overcome.

I learned that C handles white spaces by \t, \r, \n, \f, \v for different situations.
